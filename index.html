    <h1>Hello, I'm John Jones</h1>
    <p>I am a third-year computer science major, coming from Tampa, Florida. My favorite pastimes include playing video games, expanding my computer knowledge, and hanging out with my friends. 
       A fun fact about me is that I was in the Florida A&M Jazz Band for my first two years. I hope this semester brings nothing but good things!</p>
